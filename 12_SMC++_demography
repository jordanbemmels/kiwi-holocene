# Demographic inference with SMC++

Another demographic inference (alternative to PopSizeABC) is done with [SMC++](https://github.com/popgenmethods/smcpp).

## Prepare input files

SMC++ requires info about *all* sites along a chromosome, so we do not use any pre-existing site filters. We will use all scaffolds at least 1 Mbp in length. For each scaffold, create a VCF file and a corresponding .bed mask file (to show which sites are masked due to having insufficient data for all individuals), using the [bamCaller.py](https://github.com/stschiff/msmc-tools/blob/master/bamCaller.py) script available from [msmc-tools](https://github.com/stschiff/msmc-tools). This script takes piped output from [bcftools](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/). 

An example is shown for a single scaffold ("PTFB01001001.1"). Note that we are also requiring a minimum depth of 8x to retain the genotype call (+setGT command).

```
bcftools mpileup -q 20 -Q 20 -C 50 -r PTFB01001001.1 -a FORMAT/AD -d 10000 -f kiwi_ref_genome.fna -b BAM_FILES_LIST.txt | bcftools call -c -V indels | python bamCaller.py 708 maskIncluded_PTFB01001001.1.bed.gz | bcftools +setGT -- -t q -i 'FORMAT/AD[*:0] + FORMAT/AD[*:1] < 8' -n "./." | bcftools reheader -s BAM_FILES_LIST_55ind_renamed.txt | gzip -c > kiwi55_maskIncluded_PTFB01001001.1.vcf.gz
```

The output mask file kiwi55_maskIncluded_PTFB01001001.1.vcf.gz is a list of sites that are *included* across all individuals, but SMC++ requires a mask of sites that are *excluded*. So, we will have to take the inverse of the maskIncluded file. This can be done using the [provided](https://github.com/jordanbemmels/kiwi-holocene/blob/main/convertMask_includedToExcluded.R) script ```convertMask_includedToExcluded_git.R```.
