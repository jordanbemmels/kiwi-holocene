This repository contains example commands for analyses run in the manuscript:

Jordan B. Bemmels, Else K. Mikkelsen, Oliver Haddrath, Rogan M. Colbourne, Hugh A. Robertson, Jason T. Weir. Demographic decline and lineage-specific adaptations characterize New Zealand kiwi. In review.

Note that there was no substantial new program or software developed for this manuscript; rather, the focus of this repository is providing example commands demonstrating how existing software was run, as a supplement to the verbal explanations in the manuscript and manuscript supplementary info.

The pages and documents in this repository were developed by Jordan B. Bemmels (jordan.bemmels@utoronto.ca) unless otherwise specified. 

#### What this repository is:

- example commands to run existing programs
- small scripts in R and python to help organize or prepare files, if it would otherwise be difficult to document or confusing to follow
- example input files for exising programs, where relevant
- a companion to the published manuscript and manuscript supplementary info
- a demonstration showing how the key parameters and decisions were actually implemented, as already described verbally in the manuscript

#### What this repository is NOT:

- a tutorial; see existing tutorials and user manuals for complete information how to use the individual programs
- a stand-alone document; please refer to the published manuscript, especially for rationales behind why particular analyses are conducted
- new software; there is no new software or major code other than a few scripts for formatting inputs and processing outputs
- code for visualization of output or interpretation of results; see the manuscript for interpretation of results
- a complete start-to-finish guide that can be run by anyone with no modifications; in particular, the scripts have been simplified and made more generic to facilitate comprehension, with the caveat that file paths would need to be specified carefully and other minor tweaks may be necessary in order for the commands to be successfully re-run by a third-party user
